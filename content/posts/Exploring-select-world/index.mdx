Select's basic implementation in the browsers at the time of writing this article has a dropdown and options that you can choose. The select people want to use is a little more complicated and often demands features like search for options inside Select, lazy load options, multiselect options and visual que's for user to convey what's happening behind the scenes.

The basic select with options has a `select` as main tag and `options` as children containng the value. The first option will be the default value.

```
<select>
    <option value="red">Red</option>
    <option value="blue">Blue</option>
    <option value="green">Green</option>
</select>
```
